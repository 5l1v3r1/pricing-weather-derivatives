<Insert rationale for model choice (ARIMA)>

After figuring out we wanted to use an ARIMA model, the next step was to break that down further. The general process for ARIMA models is the following:
- Visualize the time series data
- Make the time series data stationary
- Plot the correlation and autocorrelation charts
- Construct the ARIMA model
- Use the model to make predictions
